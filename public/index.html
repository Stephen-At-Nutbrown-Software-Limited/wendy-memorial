  <p>26th July 1962 - 2nd October 2024</p>
<p>Wendy shared her love with so many people who she met, befriended, and cherished on her journey. She was the proud Mum of her two boys, James and Stephen and loving wife to her husband, Andrew.</p>
<p>Wendy&rsquo;s passions were people, food and music.  She travelled around the world and visited Rio; she scuba dived in the Maldives, rode a motorbike to Italy and toured around France and Germany. She crossed the Atlantic and saw whales in their natural habitat. She was a member in several choirs, notably Albion and the Cancer Choir, and through those endevours made many good friends.</p>
<p>This page is for the memory of Wendy; it provides links to several photo albums to share with friends and family. Links to these albums, as well as a link to a tribute page to make donations to St Lukes can be found below.</p>
